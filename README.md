PROVIDING FOREIGN CURRENCY TO ALL AFRICAN COUNTRIES

BUIDL Description
HERMESH FINANCE

Hermesh Finance is building a revolutionary DeFi interface taking the current DeFi model, and expanding creating a giant liquidity pool which will provide foreign currency to multinational companies, private traders, financial institutions and ordinary citizens in order for them to access international markets and remittances with no capital controls.

Our front-end interface will include the follows:

Develop a comprehensive liquidity pool

Develop Wrapped stable local currency to transfer cross bridges,

and our Economic Token called NDARAMA (GOLD) build on top of BINANCE BLOCKCHAIN to reward our members and can be swapped for other crypto currencies.

Our strength is our knowledge and understanding of “dynamic smart contracts”, the ability for our smart contracts to be able to communicate with current real world statistics, and make decisions. This is a standard above how current smart contracts operate.

Developing a financial system of this magnitude requires a complete understanding of the architecture of the system we are building.

 The system is ran on a hierarchy of smart contracts, proxies, oracles, and bridges.
